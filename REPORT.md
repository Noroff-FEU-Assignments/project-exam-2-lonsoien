Project Exam 2

##Introduction Environmentbox AS

For my project exam I chose a real life client to work with. 
Environmentbox AS is a company that develops solutions for a better storage for bicycles. 
They design and create different containers and bicycles-hotels that safely stores bicycles for communities, schools or businesses. 
They are a upcoming business that have had great sucess with their products, and saw the need to develop a new website for their business.

##Functionality the clients wanted

I started with having a meeting with my clients to get to know what they need and how they want their site to function. 
They wanted the site to be easy and neat for their customers, and easy to navigate to the products on their site. 
They especially wanted the contact form to be on all pages throughout the site at the footer. 
They wanted all their products to be listed on their homepage, so when the client enters the home-page, all the products are listed, 
and then each listing direct to their own product detail site. 
They wanted their navigation menu to stick at the top, and have a small brand logo on the top side. 
It was important to have a drop-down menu, where each product is also listed to navigate to the detail product site. 
They wanted to have a project site where they could post their projects and cooperations with other businesses, schools and communities. 
For their projects, they wanted a carousel just to show off some of the projects on their homepage. 
They wanted their cooperation businesses logo to be listed at the bottom underneath their projects carousel at the homepage. 
They wanted a about page with their profile picture and contact details.


##Design and Prototype Process

I prefer and used the Adobe package to create my styletile and prototype (Adobe XD). 
This way I could easily share the link to my clients so they could follow my designer process.

I researched community sites, and competitors to have an idea of how a their sites are build, witch colors and functions they used on their site. 
For the design I chose to have the background white and the client really liked the color palette of beige. 
The logo contains the color green to represent an evironment friendly message to their customers. 
As this was a very important message the clients wanted me to have in mind, as they focus are on environment, and create products 
that habitats easily in nature.

I descided to create a card layout for their products on the page, as this looks professional and easy on the eyes. 
For the fonts, I researched a long time, to find the right combination with the headings H1 to stand out and look professional. 
I really liked the font "Roc Grotesk Wide Medium", and chose the rest of the fonts based to fit the heading. 
"Poppins Medium" and "Poppins Bold" and "Poppins Regular" I choose to use on the sub-headings and as the content text. 
I thought it matches the links and buttons, and didnt feel the need to use any other fonts to the site.

The client really loved the color #DFD4C0 (beige). I started to create the styletile and prototype with finding the best matching with this color. 
The client wanted to use beige on almost every aspect of the site as background, forms, buttons, and background color on the product images, but 
after showing a first test prototype, the client agreed to tone down the usage of the same color, and gave me their trust to create the page as 
web-friendly as possible.

The designing process took a bit longer than expected as the client did change their mind many times at first, but after showing them some of the design 
they wanted compared with my input and suggestions, they agreed on my final prototype. 
I placed the header image underneath the H1 heading, as I wanted the visitors of the site to focus on the Environmentbox name first.

The images the client sent did not have the best quality, but I tried to edit my best to make it "web-friendly". 
In the future I will update the images, as they are planning a professional photoshoot for their products. 
So I didnt spend to much time editing this, as the client only could provide what was given on this project. 
The content and carousel was placed centred on the pages after the clients wishes. 
The client wanted the products pages and project page to have centered content. 
On the homepage its the same type of layout, ecxept the product cards with I changed to have a 2 column space, as I thought this looked neater 
and more professional. 
A carousel function where used on all the products as this was the neatest way to create a show place for the multiple images for their products. 
All the content on the project pages is listed in the centre of the page with a title, content and a date of the post. 
Sadly I didnt get enough time in the end to solve the issues to get the right endpoint of the feaured media from my wordpress API. 
The intent was that if wanted, a image also can be added to showpiece the project post. 
The login and login form, CORS functionality I decided not to spent to much time to design other on the focus of the simplicity of how to 
interact with the posts on the dashboard page.


##Planning and Functionality Process

I created a trello board to put up all the different tasks to manage from week 1 to week 7. 
I also shared the trello board link with my clients so that they could see or interact with the timeline process. 
Using trello before, I experienced that its more understandable to mark labels on all tasks where each task has a color, for example 
design tasks purple, code tasks yellow and ect. 
I also created a Ghant chart on my own computer, and made a dairy on what ive done for the day or week, and what was missing or simply 
issues I had along the way that I had to solve within a due-date. 
This was more for a personal usage, to have full controll over my work-schedual and timeline. 
Also to keep a overview of what ive done, what needs improvement, and what issues or bug fixes that still was not solved, or other 
functinalities or tasks that needed an extra check.

Starting the project exam, I was conflicted to use React or Next. 
After creating and finishing the prototype, I ended with using React App for my project. 
I priotized to build the routes and pages first, and then to start working on the homepage functionality and functions. 
After getting more confident on how to use React Bootstrap, I felt buildning the other pages got less time consuming and less time spending 
on problem sovling.

I did go back to the homepage in the end of the project, to change some of the functionality and split up to different components, as I 
realized having to much code in one file, is confusing and can be difficult to navigate around when changes needed to be made. 
I do feel happy about how I organized my components, and spliting up all the functionalities in different files made the coding process 
more fun and understandable.

To create my API I chose to use Wordpress as CMS. 
This because ive have experience in working with wordpress before in previous projects. 
The client did not have any enquires on witch cms to use, so Wordpress was an easy pick. 
I did have some challenges working on wordpress with React, and still have a lot to learn here. 
I chose to build my local wordpress with Local by Flywheel and then used one.com as my hosting service. 
I feel confident using Local by Flywheel and find this program easy for a mac user. 
I then created the project content as posts in wordpress, to be used with JWT CORS plugin installation. 
The process of building the post, add, delete posts functionality was the process I have feared the most during the project. 
I havent been succesful creating this before, so I felt this was fun to get finally to work together.

The client got really happy about the option of adding Hotjar to their site. 
They didnt know this is a functionality that they could easily monitor on their own for free! So they where really exited about this function.

##My experience - what im happy about, what im not happy about

I found my choice to use a real client for this project was very fun and most of all a big learning experience. 
To work with actual clients compare to a school project is a lot different in a good and bad way. 
I learned that the clients often dont know maybe what they really want, or that they can quickly change their mind on some aspects. 
I feel I learned that working with a client will provide unexpected challenges as you have started the proccess. 
I am glad that the client was happy with my advices and inputs from a frontend developers prespective and experiences. 
And that they listened to my ideas.

I am very happy with my design, and feel I have managed to produce what the client wanted. 
I also feel my choice of layout, components, colurs and fonts matched their brand identity very well, on how they want to be perviced as a business. 
I am also happy with the way I managed the organization for my files and structure of the site.

I wish I had the time to create my own icons, instead of using the font awsome application. 
But futher on the project im gonna look into UI libaries and icon choices to develop this to the next level. 
I am also frustrated that I didnt get to solve the endpoint of my API to get the featured media to display on the project page. 
This will be a continued task im going to solve for the client.

I am very happy about how I resolved this project with the React App. 
I felt I maybe didnt have enough skills to work well with this JS framework, when it came to building a big project like this with a real client. 
My expreience was a huge learning process, but a fun one! This gave me the taste on how to work with a real client and how to work in the 
industry after school.

I am super exited about the future and want to practice and learn more to become a top frontend deveolper, where there are no limits to 
what I can build and create.
