## Goal
The client wanted to create a new webpage for their company Enviromentbox AS. This is a client I chose to work with for my project exam. 

Environmentbox AS is a company that develops solutions for a better storage for bicycles. They design and create different containers and bicycles-hotels that safely stores bicycles for communities, schools or businesses. They are a upcoming business that have had great sucess with their products, and saw the need to develop a new website for their business.

The website had to contain all listed products on their home-page as they have created a QR-Code to their domain that directs to the homepage. 

The client can log in to an admin page, and add their own posts for their oncoming projects and collabrations. 

## Brief

   # Summary 
   
I found my choice to use a real client for this project was very fun and most of all a big learning experience. 

To work with actual clients compare to a school project is a lot different in a good and bad way. I learned that the clients often dont know maybe what they really want, or that they can quickly change their mind on some aspects. I feel I learned that working with a client will provide unexpected challenges as you have started the proccess. I am glad that the client was happy with my advices and inputs from a frontend developers prespective and experiences. And that they listened to my ideas.

The designing prossess took a much longer time than was given, but the client was happy with the prototype in the end. 
I planned the process with Trello (kanban board) and shared the work-board with the client so the client could interact. 

For the JWT CORS requirements given in the exam brief I chose Wordpress, as this was preferable with the client. 

The business identity was important for the client to come across as serious, simple, neat and evironment friendly.

I am happy with what I have produced so far. There are room for improvements, and this will be a continued project for the real world client, witch I am very exited about. I feel I have learned a lot during working on this project exam, and encountered a lot of problems that I previous havent solved before. It was a huge learning experience to work with the client, and the importance of communication throghout the project.
